# üìä Recipe Site Traffic Prediction - Data Science Project

## üèÜ Project Overview
This project is part of my **Data Scientist Certification**, where I was tasked with developing a model to **predict which recipes will lead to high website traffic**. The challenge was given by the **product team**.

The goal was to **correctly predict high-traffic recipes at least 80% of the time** while minimizing the risk of displaying unpopular ones. More traffic means more subscriptions, making this a key business problem.

## üë®‚Äçüíª My Role
As the **Data Scientist**, I:
- **Cleaned and validated** the dataset for inconsistencies.
- **Explored the data** to identify trends and key drivers of recipe popularity.
- **Developed machine learning models** to predict high-traffic recipes.
- **Evaluated performance** using precision-recall metrics.
- **Provided business insights** based on the findings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used

### Data Processing & Manipulation
- Pandas ‚Üí Data handling, filtering, and transformation
- NumPy ‚Üí Numerical computations and array operations
- Scikit-learn (ColumnTransformer, StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder) ‚Üí Data preprocessing

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Statistical Testing
- Matplotlib & Seaborn ‚Üí Data visualization (histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps)
- Scipy (chi2_contingency) ‚Üí Chi-squared test for categorical variable relationships
- Correlation Analysis ‚Üí Identifying relationships between features
- Feature Distributions ‚Üí Understanding variable behavior

### Machine Learning & Model Training
- Scikit-learn (GradientBoostingClassifier, SVC, LogisticRegression, etc.) ‚Üí Supervised learning classification models
- Scikit-learn (RandomizedSearchCV) ‚Üí Hyperparameter tuning
- Pipeline with ColumnTransformer ‚Üí Streamlining preprocessing and model training

### Model Evaluation & Performance Metrics
- Creation of custom scorer (Precision at Fixed Recall - 80%) ‚Üí Ensuring high-traffic recipes are prioritized
- Scikit-learn (roc_auc_score, f1_score, precision_recall_curve) ‚Üí Performance evaluation

###  Model Explainability & Business Insights
- SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) ‚Üí Feature impact visualization
- Support Vector Analysis ‚Üí Identifying most influential data points

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach & Methodology

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Validation & Cleaning**
- Checked for missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
- Verified that the dataset matched the business problem requirements.
- Encoded categorical features and scaled numerical values.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Identified trends in **calories, carbohydrates, sugar, protein, and servings**.
- Visualized **how different categories impact traffic**.
- Used **correlation heatmaps and distribution plots** to find patterns.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Development and Evaluation**
- **Baseline Model:** A simple model to establish initial performance.
- Other **Machine Learning Models** (Classifiers) e.g.:
    - Random Forest Classifier
    - Gradient Boosting Classifier
    - **Support Vector Machine (SVC)** ‚Üí chosen model as the best
    - Logistic Regression for comparison
- Used **Precision at 80% Recall** to ensure high-traffic recipes are prioritized.
- Evaluated models with **ROC-AUC, F1-score, and Precision-Recall AUC**.
- Tuned hyperparameters with **RandomizedSearchCV**.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Business Insights & Recommendations**
- Recipes with **higher protein and carbohydrate content tend to attract more traffic**.
- Certain recipe categories (e.g., **Potato**, **Vegetable**) are more likely to generate high traffic.
- **Serving size plays a role** ‚Äî recipes with more servings tend to be more popular.
- **Sugar content is less relevant** to recipe popularity compared to other features.
- **A machine learning model can assist in homepage recipe selection** to improve traffic prediction accuracy.

## üñºÔ∏è Visualizations & Reports
- **Data Cleaning & EDA:** Histograms, Boxplots, and Correlation pairplots.
- **Feature Importance:** SHAP values and Permutation Importance.
